# Image Interface

The plug-in seeks an alternative method of form-generation through pixel color data. The project approaches color as a media that instructs
space from 2-dimensional images. The instruction is guided by mathematical equations that embody the configuration of volumes. The
equations formulate around converting red, green, and blue information to hue, saturation, and value. RGB is a color sorting system that sorts
color into a cubic shape, and HSV sorts color into a cylindrical shape. The outcome of the project is to create an immersive experience through
color that challenges the traditional architectural notion of form-generation.
