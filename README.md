# Image Interface

The plug-in seeks an alternative method to form generation through pixel color data. The project appoarch color as a media that instruct space from 2-dimensional images. The instruction guided by mathematical equations that embody the confi guration of volumes. The equations formulate around converting red, green, and blue information to hue, saturation, and value. RGB is a color sorting system that sort color into a cubic shape and HSV sort color into a cylindrical shape. The outcome of the project is to create an immersive experience through color that challenges traditional architectural notion of form generation.
